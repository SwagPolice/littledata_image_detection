# littledata_image_detection
Training a CNN for multiclass image detection using Keras (Tensorflow) with little data.

This repository is dedicated to Machine Learning beginners who want to create their own CNN model using their own datasets.
The goal is to offer the possibility to:
- create a simple model
- artificially increase the data quantity
- train the model
- test it
- eventually convert it to .mlmodel for Apple CoreML and to Tensorflow for Android apps.

Of course, this repository is more a collection of useful functions and scripts rather than an original program.
Each source is quoted in their respective scripts.
